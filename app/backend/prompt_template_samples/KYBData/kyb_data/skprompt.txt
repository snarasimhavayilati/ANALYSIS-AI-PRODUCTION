This is JSON Data: {{$input}} .
Act as a compliance officer checking Know Your Business (KYB). 
List any issues you see in the following categories: 'addresses', 'watchlist', 'bankruptcies', 'certifications', 'documents', 'liens', 'names', 'litigations', 'actions', 'policy_results' 
If any category contains null, none, or an empty array, it indicates no problem. 
However, if there are any values in these categories, find the issues as you would when checking KYB and present them in paragraph or line format, not in JSON.
